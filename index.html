<!-- The content for the `index.html` should be unique to **you**.

   * Write a paragraph or two about yourself. Make it fun, show your personality!
   * The main logo where it says "Your Name" should say your name. This may make the logo section smaller or wider depending on how long your name isâ€”that is fine and expected.
   * Add, commit, and push your code to GitHub often, especially when you complete a page. -->

    <h1>About Me</h1>

        I graduated from the Kansas City Art Institute with a BFA in Printmaking. I ended up working at a small e-commerce business managing their ERP system. I want to advance my career with web development skills.
